I obtained my MSc in <strong>Electrical and Computers Engineering </strong>from University Instituto Superior Técnico (<a target="_blank" href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">IST</a>) in Lisbon, Portugal, with specialization in Decision Systems and Control. My masters thesis involved developing an outlier detection system for multivariate temporal data suited to a wide range of applications.
