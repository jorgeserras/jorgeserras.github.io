  Hi! My name is <strong>Jorge luís Fuzeta Serras</strong> and I am a devoted open source developer and engineer hailing from Lisbon, Portugal. I am always exploring new technology related areas, retaining knowledge of numerous scopes from web development to the area of electronics.

<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I obtained my MSc in <strong>Electrical and Computers Engineering </strong>from University Instituto Superior Técnico (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ipu.ac.in/usict/">IST</a>) in Lisbon, Portugal, with specialization in Decision Systems and Control. My masters thesis involved developing an outlier detection system for multivariate temporal data suited to a wide range of applications.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
